# Pike-Engine
 A comminty driven (portable) pygame editor + python code editor.
 As far as thing's go, so far most of this is WIP. I am hoping to achieve a community driven game-engine / editor.
 
 Feel free to submit pull requests!


Features so far:

 1. Python code editing.
 2. play / run game.
 3. add or remove game objects.
 4. move gameobjects around in the scene.
 5. save & load (kinda broken) to .pik (json style)
 6. engine / coder can be exported to .exe with ease. (using pytoexe)


Steps to use:
 1. [Install python ](https://www.python.org/downloads/)
 2. Install pygame ["pip install pygame"](https://www.pygame.org/wiki/GettingStarted)
 3. Install PyQt5 "pip install PyQt5"
 4. Run in your local IDE / python runner or use [Sublime Text ](https://www.sublimetext.com)https://www.sublimetext.com
 5. PROFIT!
