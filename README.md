# Pike-Engine
 A comminty driven (portable) pygame editor + python code editor.
 As far as thing's go, so far most of this is WIP. I am hoping to achieve a community driven game-engine / editor.
 
 Feel free to submit pull requests!


Features so far:

 * Python code editing.
 * play / run game.
 * add or remove game objects.
 * move gameobjects around in the scene.
 * save & load (kinda broken) to .pik (json style)
 * engine / coder can be exported to .exe with ease. (using pytoexe)

Future plans:

 * EXE Releases.
 * Lots of features & bug fixes!
 * Clear Documentation.
 * Easy use.
 * Both the pike-editor & pike-code editor to be flexible / separable in releases.
 * Discord community.
 * Crowd funding.

Steps to use:
 1. [Install python ](https://www.python.org/downloads/)
 2. Install pygame ["pip install pygame"](https://www.pygame.org/wiki/GettingStarted)
 3. Install PyQt5 "pip install PyQt5"
 4. Run in your local IDE / python runner or use [Sublime Text ](https://www.sublimetext.com)https://www.sublimetext.com
 5. PROFIT!
